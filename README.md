## Style guides used

## Notes

I never needed/wanted to build a bare Python server before this task.
Is quite interesting to see what the Frameworks that I often use do
underneath.

That said, I want to be completely honest regarding my approaches
(that you can check in commits messages/code) and knowledge sources.

Some of what's implemented in the request handler came from [here][gist-link].

Instructions coming soon!
